# About Me :wave:

Hello everyone! I'm Sline. You find me right here on the FexCube GitHub where I solve problems and continually push Frogs-Team forward. Ultimately, our successes are shared. I am successful when you are successful.

Although I'm relatively younger than Java, I've been writing software since the 2021s. I have devoted most of my career to creating products for the Minecraft game. Recently, I have been passing on my experience to other people.<hr>
